By knowing how they differ, you can then ensure you use each one effectively at the right time. Get started by checking out the following helpful guide to SQL, MySQL, and NoSQL.</p>
                    <h4 className='text-muted'>What Are SQL, MySQL, and NoSQL?</h4>
                    <p>Structured Query Language, commonly known by the abbreviation SQL, is a programming language that is used to manage data that is held in a relational database management system or for stream processing in a relational database management system.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                    MySQL is a relational database management system that uses SQL. Whereas SQL is primarily used to query and operate database systems, MySQL enables you to store, handle, delete, and modify data in an organized way.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                    As for NoSQL, it is a non-relational database that does not use SQL. NoSQL databases use a simpler data structure, meaning they are quicker, more responsive, and more scalable than traditional relational databases.</p>
                    <h4 className='text-muted'>The Key Differences Between MySQL and NoSQL</h4>
                    <p>By knowing the precise differences between MySQL and NoSQL, you can use each effectively. Both are popular market choices, so it is important that you learn about the differences to find the right option for your needs.<br></br>
                    
                    Here are some of the key differences between MySQL and NoSQL.<br></br><br></br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>First off, MySQL is a relational database that is based on a tabular design. NoSQL is non-relational and has a document-based design.</li>
                        <li>A MySQL database is currently more popular in the market than NoSQL because the latter is still fairly new. That means, at present, MySQL encompasses a large community while NoSQL has a comparatively small community.</li>
                        <li>While MySQL is not easily scalable due to rigid schema restrictions, NoSQL can easily be scaled because of its dynamic schema nature.</li>
                        <li>Another key difference is MySQL requires a detailed database model before the creation of the database while NoSQL requires no detailed modeling.</li>
                        <li>Also, unlike MySQL, which is a type of relational database, NoSQL is more design-based, with examples like CouchDB and MongoDB. Furthermore, NoSQL is much more flexible than MySQL.</li>
                        <li>One of the good things about MySQL database management is that it is available with a broad range of reporting tools that can help the validity of an application. On the other hand, NoSQL databases do not have reporting tools for performance testing and analysis.</li>
                    </ol>
